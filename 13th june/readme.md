1.Write a C Program to calculate Electricity Bill
Given an integer U denoting the amount of KWh units of electricity consumed, the task is to calculate the electricity bill with the help of the below charges:
• 1 to 100 units – Rs. 10/- Per Unit
• 100 to 200 units – Rs. 15/- Per Unit
• 200 to 300 units – Rs. 20/- Per Unit
• above 300 units – Rs. 25/- Per Unit
Examples:
Input: U = 250
Output: 3500
Explanation:
Charge for the first 100 units – 10100 = 1000
Charge for the 100 to 200 units – 15100 = 1500
Charge for the 200 to 250 units – 20*50 = 1000
Total Electricity Bill = 1000 + 1500 + 1000 = 3500
